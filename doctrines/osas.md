# Once Saved, Always Saved
This doctrine teaches that once someone believes the Gospel and gets saved they can't lose their salvation. They are eternally secure. 		

41+ Verses / Passages

### Psalm 89:30-33	
```If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.```

(Not keeping God's commandments does not equate to loss of salvation. But rather it yields	chastisement. God remains faithful to his children	who break his commandments. His lovingkindness	is not taken from them either.)	

### Hebrews 10:10-14 and Acts 26:18	
```By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.```
	
```To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me```	

The one offering of Jesus Christ perfects those who are sanctified through faith in Christ for ever. If someone who is sanctified could lose their salvation they would no longer be perfected, they would no longer be sanctified, and it would have not been for ever. If this were to ever happen it would completely contradict verse 14 because it says those who are sanctified are perfected for ever. Which means there will never be a point in time where the sanctified are not perfect.

## Hebrews 13:5, Colossians 1:27,  1 John 4:4, and 1 Corinthians 6:19

```Let your contention be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.```

```To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:```

```Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.```

```What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?```

 God is inside all believers.

## 1 Corinthians 1:25 		
```Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.```

God is stronger and wiser than all men.

## 1 John 3:20 20 
```For if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things.```

Even if a saved person condemns themselves, God is greater than that. 

## 2 Timothy 2:13
```If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.```

For a believer to lose their salvation without contradicting when Hebrews 13:5 says "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee" they would have to remove God from themselves. In order to do that they must be stronger than God. They would also have to make God deny himself. Which he cannot do. Because even if a believer lacks faith, God abides in them. And if God left them, He would have to deny himself because doing so contradicts his character and would make God a liar.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:9, John 3:36, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9
```For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ``` 

```He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.``` 

```In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:  Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;```

Appoint means to commit or assign. God has committed and assigned salvation to those who are saved. And God has not committed and assigned wrath to those who are saved. John 3:36 divides people into two groups. Those who are saved and have life. And those who aren't saved and have the wrath of God upon them. If someone could lose salvation they would then be under God's wrath. This would contradict 1 Thess. 5:9 because God has not committed or assigned wrath to us. But He has instead committed and assigned salvation to us.

## Revelation 2:11, 3:5, 1 John 5:4-5
```He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death. ```
```He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels Revelation 20:14 14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.```
```For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?```

Believing the gospel is overcoming the world. Anyone who has believed the gospel won't have their name blotted out. And they won't go to hell. The only condition given to not having your name blotted out is if you believed the gospel. No mortal sins are listed as conditions that would cause a believer's name to be blotted out due to loss of salvation. Nobody who has overcome by believing the gospel can go to hell.
